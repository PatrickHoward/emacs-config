* DONE Fix auto-fill-mode not working properly
 - It claims that it's on, but its not automatically inserting newlines, I've
   been having to do it manually.

* TODO Setup ~org-crypt~ on config
 - Would like to be able to encrypt org files so I can store them wherever.

* TODO Kanban doesn't seem to be setup correctly
 - I tried to use it on the table above, but to no luck
 - Ideally, I could create Kanbans out of a collection of TODOs in an org
   file.
