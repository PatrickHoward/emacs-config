#+TITLE: Config Todos

* DONE Fix auto-fill-mode not working properly                    :ARCHIVE:
 - It claims that it's on, but its not automatically inserting newlines, I've
   been having to do it manually.

* TODO Setup ~org-crypt~ on config
 - Would like to be able to encrypt org files so I can store them wherever.

* TODO Kanban doesn't seem to be setup correctly
 - I tried to use it on the table above, but to no luck
 - Ideally, I could create Kanbans out of a collection of TODOs in an org
   file.
* DONE Improve pmh/install-config-packages to actually scale correctly :ARCHIVE:
 - Instead of install-config-packages having a massive list of ~package-install~ function calls, I should
   have a list of packages for install.
 - I'm stupid, ~use-package~ with ~:ensure~ set, is the exact thing I was looking
   for, I don't even need to have two separate files anymore ❤️


* TODO Show/Hide Treemacs if the frame's size is above or below a certain size.
