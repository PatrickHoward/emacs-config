#+TITLE: Config Todos

* DONE Fix auto-fill-mode not working properly
 - It claims that it's on, but its not automatically inserting newlines, I've
   been having to do it manually.

* TODO Setup ~org-crypt~ on config
 - Would like to be able to encrypt org files so I can store them wherever.

* TODO Kanban doesn't seem to be setup correctly
 - I tried to use it on the table above, but to no luck
 - Ideally, I could create Kanbans out of a collection of TODOs in an org
   file.

* TODO Improve pmh/install-config-packages to actually scale correctly
 - Instead of install-config-packages having a massive list of ~package-install~ function calls, I should
   have a list of packages for install.
